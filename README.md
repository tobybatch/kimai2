# Kimai Dockers

After 6 years of maintaining a separate repo for this project we have, as of Jan 8th 2024 officially folded the docker files into the main [Kimai](https://github.com/kimai/kimai) repo. 

The built images are still pushed to [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kimai/kimai2)

Documentation is available as part of the core [Kimai docker documentation](https://github.com/kimai/kimai/issues)

Issues can now be raised on the [issues page](https://www.kimai.org/documentation/docker.html) of the main Kimai repo.

The old README is [here](./README.orig.md) just in case you wanted it.
